# Image Segmentation Using Clustering Techniques

## Description
This project focuses on implementing image segmentation using clustering algorithms such as K-Means. The goal is to divide an image into distinct segments or regions.

This project was completed during the third year of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, for the subject **Intelligent Systems**.

## Purpose
The project demonstrates how clustering techniques can be applied to segment images into meaningful regions, which is essential for image analysis and computer vision tasks.

## Technologies Used
- Python Programming Language
- Scikit-learn for clustering algorithms (K-Means, GaussianMixture) and skfuzzy for uzzy C-Means
